# Five-frame-difference-for-object-detection
This code works with five continuous frames and yields the moving objects in a video 
In most of the background subtraction schemes, background construction and updatation is the most important challenge. For the construction of the background a set of sequences are used. In case of any interesting activity that happens within the background construction process can not be detected. This scheme is a solution to that.

Run the code and enjoy...!!!
